# Implementation Plan for mqtt2ntfy

This document outlines the incremental stages for implementing the mqtt2ntfy Go program. Each stage focuses on small, testable changes that compile and pass tests before proceeding.

## Stage 1: Project Setup and CLI Parsing
**Goal**: Set up basic structure, CLI parsing, and config loading framework.
**Success Criteria**: Program accepts `--config` flag, loads YAML into a struct, and exits with error on invalid config.
**Tests**: Unit tests for CLI parsing and YAML loading.
**Status**: Completed

## Stage 2: MQTT Connection and Subscription
**Goal**: Connect to MQTT broker and subscribe to the topic.
**Success Criteria**: Program connects to a test MQTT broker and logs subscription success.
**Tests**: Unit tests for connection logic; integration tests with a mock broker.
**Status**: Completed

## Stage 3: Ntfy Forwarding
**Goal**: Forward MQTT messages to Ntfy server.
**Success Criteria**: Messages from MQTT are sent to Ntfy and logged; handle HTTP errors gracefully.
**Tests**: Unit tests for HTTP client; integration tests with a mock Ntfy server.
**Status**: Completed

## Stage 4: Error Handling, Logging, and Polish
**Goal**: Robust error handling, logging, and graceful shutdown.
**Success Criteria**: Program handles disconnections, retries, and signals; logs are clear and structured.
**Tests**: Tests for error scenarios and signal handling.
**Status**: Completed

## Stage 5: Testing and Validation
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and end-to-end validation.
**Success Criteria**: All tests pass; program works with real MQTT/Ntfy.
**Tests**: Add integration tests; ensure 80%+ coverage.
**Status**: Completed
